----

The **MCPrinciple**, a community that encourages players to create freely, was founded in September 2022. The original intention is to disseminate the principles and rules of research to everyone better, to prevent disputes to the greatest extent, and to create a better environment for the community.  

It is based on the group public welfare server. At present, the main server is **MCPrinciple-Ultimate** (Server A). There are three servers under its umbrella, all of which are operated by non-profit practices.  

The **PrincipleDEV** development team, a branch of *BUGdev*, was formed by a group of dedicated and creative players who developed Mods for the Java version of **Minecraft** and wrote *Java applications*.  

The inspiration of the **MCPrinciple** community comes from the previous excellent community **MCBUG**, and the original intention of the **MCPrinciple** is to manage the whole world in a different way, take a different path, carry forward the spirit, stay true to the original intention, and be more innovative and positive.  

> ***Take the principle as the basic, take the good as the example, take humanity as the guide. We believe that as long as everyone can be good and believe in good, then there will be no strife, no hatred, no chaos in our social circle.***  

*We will not concede defeat, we will not bow down, we will operate the community until the end of the world.*
